        I'm bad at writing stories.</p> <p class="svelte-vq73lf">I have started learning web development and programming in general since I was in
        8th grade. Back then, I was just making some simple scripts for a small .io game
        called <a href="https://zombs.io" target="_blank" class="svelte-vq73lf">zombs.io</a>, though I learned a
        lot from it!</p> <p class="svelte-vq73lf">I moved on from making scripts to doing a wide variety of projects when I was in
        1st year of high school. Being in an advanced high school is tough though, I had
        to shift my focus away from this hobby from time to time. Nonetheless, I enjoyed
        making things on the web (and still do!).</p> <p class="svelte-vq73lf">In 2nd year, I learned some languages other than JavaScript, like C++ and Swift
        just to try my hands on things other than the web, some frameworks too. <span class="svelte-vq73lf">(as you can see, I made this website with SvelteKit!)</span></p></div>`);function n(s){var e=l();t(s,e)}export{n as component};
